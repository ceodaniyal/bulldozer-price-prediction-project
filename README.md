# Bulldozer Price Prediction Project
This project focuses on predicting bulldozer prices using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can accurately estimate the selling price of bulldozers based on various features provided in the dataset.

## Project Overview
The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building a predictive model to estimate bulldozer prices. The dataset includes information about bulldozer features such as model, year of manufacture, usage, and other relevant attributes.

## Key Features
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the dataset to prepare it for modeling.
- Feature Engineering: Creating and selecting features that improve model performance.
- Model Building: Implementing and training machine learning algorithms to predict bulldozer prices.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Required Python libraries (listed in requirements.txt)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

bash
```
git clone https://github.com/ceodaniyal/bulldozer-price-prediction-project.git
cd bulldozer-price-prediction-project
```
2. Install the required libraries:

bash
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
```
jupyter notebook Bulldozer_Price_Prediction.ipynb
```
## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook and follow the steps to preprocess the data, build the model, and evaluate its performance.
Modify the notebook to test different models or refine the feature engineering process.
## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of XX% (replace with actual value) in predicting bulldozer prices. Key metrics include RMSE and MAE.
